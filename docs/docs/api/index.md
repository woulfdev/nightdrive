# API Reference 

The API reference provides a slightly more detailed documenation about the API endpoints than [openapi.json](https://github.com/woulfdev/nightdrive){:target="_blank"}, including some examples for the intended use of a endpoint. As well as its use in the mobile App.

!!! warning "Finality of endpoints"

    Until the API reaches version `0.0.1` endpoints might still change a lot and you should refere to [openapi.json](https://github.com/woulfdev/nightdrive){:target="_blank"} for the most up to date documentation.
